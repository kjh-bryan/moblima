Problem Definition
----------------------
MOBLIMA is an application to computerize the processes of making online booking and purchase of movie tickets, listing of movies and sale reporting. It will be used by the moviegoers and cinema staff. The application acts as a centralized ‘location’ for making bookings for all the Cineplexes in different locations managed by the vendor. 

Required following functionalities:
----------------------
- ### Movie-goers
  - Movie listings and showtimes can be queried and booking can be made.
  - From the movie listings, movie-goer can also view the information about the movie.
    - Movie title
    - Showing status [Coming Soon, Preview, Now Showing]
    - SYNOPSIS – movie abstract
    - Director
    - Cast (at least 2)
    - Overall reviewer rating (1 – 5 [best])
    - Past reviews and reviewers’ ratings
  - A layout of each cinema will be presented for seat selections upon booking.
  - Upon booking, the application will capture the movie-goer’s name, mobile number and email address. Each payment will have a transaction id (TID)
  - Movie-goer can check their history of bookings. 
  - Movie-goer can also enter his/her review and rating
  
- ### Cinema Staff
  - Cinema staff needs to login to access its functions
  - Cinema staff can configure the system settings (e.g., ticket prices, holidays, etc.)
    - Movie title

  - Cinema staff can also update the details of the movies or remove the movie by changing the status to ‘End of Showing’.
